# Passport.js
#Jsonwebtokens

This is a basic application to demonstrate the use of passport.js (used the local strategy here) for authentication, along with nodejs for the server side programming 
and mysql for backend database.

Also used passport-jwt to verify the token generated and the access rights are given according to the payload to the users.
